*一本和生活态度息息相关的书。。。*

今天在书柜里又看到了这本书，真的有很多的感慨。

说起这本书，还得谢谢小猪，记得当时还是刚上高三，刚刚结束了让人蛋疼无比的竞赛，不用说也知道，结果并不那么让人满意，我知道我并不是一个聪明的人，而竞赛需要的更多的是一种天资。怎么说呢，我不知道那时候的生活除了绝望还有什么。没几天就是高考了，但是除了化学以外，我所有的课程水平还不如一个刚入学的高一学生。我可以说我没有浪费每一天的时间，但是，这个重要吗？自己的知识结构就是一个破沙袋，千疮百孔，告别了那些竞赛题，感觉生活一下子不一样了，不论我说什么，都会变得苍白无力，也许就像那时候学长说的一样，竞赛不是一条捷径，是一个不成功便成仁的豪赌。也许这就是一个人生的低谷吧，无意中和小猪说起自己的无奈。小猪就建议我去读读《The Secret》。于是去当当买了一本，我想有时候，命运的改变就是在一句话之间。

拿到书我便读了起来，我的最真切的感受就是相见恨晚。说句实在话，像吸引力法则这样的东西，我不知道我是不是该去相信，用正元的话说这就是一种黑科技，没有办法证真，也没有办法证伪。事实如此。但是我认为，我可以去相信它，相信不一定是去沉迷。我认为它对我最大的影响就是它给我了一个保持好心态的理由。我不用去质疑我为什么要保持这样的心态。当然，有些事情也是不得不说的，我也不得不感慨，有时候生活之于我，是不是多了太多的玩笑。。。或者说是太多的恶意。

看看现在的书里，依旧夹着那时候的读书笔记。里面有原文的摘录也有自己的一些感悟，我现在把这些拿出来与大家分享，也算是一种自勉。

Everything that's coming into your life you are attracting into your life. And it's a attracted to you by virtue of the images you're holding in your mind. It's what you're thinking. Whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you.

{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}

When you're feeling down, did you know that you can change it in an instant? Put on a beautiful piece of music, or start singing - that'll change your emotion. Or think of something beautiful. Think of a baby or somebody that you truly love, and do well on it. Really keep that thought in your mind. Block everything out but that thought. I guarantee you'll start to feel good. Make a list of some Secret Shifters to have up your Sleeve. By Secreat Shifters, I mean things that can change your feelings in a snap. It might be beautiful memories, future events, funny moments, nature, a person you love, your favourite music. Then if you find yourself angry or frustrated or not feeling good, turn to your Secret Shifters list and focus on one of them. Different things will shift you at different times, so if one doesn't work, go to another. It only takes a minute or two of changing focus to shift yourself and shift your frequency.

{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}

It is the combination of thought and love which forms the irresisible force of the law of attraction.

{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}

If you could wrap every thought in love, if you could love everything and everyone. Your life would be transformed.

{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}

The most important thing for you to know is that it is impossible ti feel bad and at the same time be having good thoughts. That would defy the law, because your thoughts cause your feelings. If you are feeling bad, it is because you are thinking thoughts that are making you feel bad.

{% endblockquote %}

暂且摘录这么多，简单点说我们需要时时刻刻保持一个好的心态，就算生活里有点不快，但总体已经是好的。别让自己的生活充满阴影~与诸君共勉。
