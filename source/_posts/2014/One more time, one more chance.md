*一首有故事的歌。据说喜欢的人都是有故事的人。*

<!-- more -->

又一次的听见了这一首歌曲，只是，这一次是一个完全不同的版本，这次是一个女声独唱的英文的版本，又是另外的一种滋味，但是依旧是那一支唱在心里的歌。听得越久，心中那种那种感觉就越发的久久不能平静。

也许就像歌词中写的那样，如果只是想排遣寂寞，那么找谁都可以。但是我却不能再欺骗我自己。

有时候有些东西一旦错过也许永远都不会再一次回来，仔细想想，在曾经的某一刻是不是有某个人曾经也令自己内心为之一颤，是不是有哪个人，藏在心底一直都不曾对别人说起。现在这个人又在哪里？又是怎么样的呢？

太多太多的未知，听到最多的一句话就是在前面一定会有一个人等着你的，那么就让我期待着，谁会是出现在我生命里一直陪伴我的那一个？

Tell me how much more do I have to lost

Before I can ever forgive myself

Do you know how much more pain I must endure

Before I can ever see your face again

One more time

Tell me why the season keep on changing

One more time

Missing all the times that we shared as one

All those times when we used to argue back and forth

I always just let you have it your way

What kind of spell did you cast on me

I even loved all of your selfish ways

One more chance

When I find mysely lost in those memories

One more chance

I don't know where to land

It doesn't matter where I am because

I can't help but look for you everywhere

On the station platform,

in the alley windows

I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there

Never thought I would wish upon a star

I just want to be there by your side

There's nothing that I won't do, I'd give up everything

Just to hold you in my arms, one more time

If all I wanted was just not to be alone,

I should be happy with just anyone

But tonight the stars are hanging by a thread,

and I can't lie to myself anymore

One more time

Tell me why the seasons keep on changing

One more time

Missing all the times that we shared as one

It doesn't matter where I am because

Can't help but look for you everywhere

At the intersection, even in my dreams

Knowing there is no way you would be there

If I could just believe in miracles

I would do anything to show you now

In the morning light, completely new me

I'd tell you what I couldn't say before,

"I love you"

Memories of our summers together ooh

Our beating hearts were heard no more

It doesn't matter where I am because

Can't help but look for you everywhere

The morning sun rises, city of Sakuragi

I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there

Never thought I would wish upon a star

I just need you right here by my side

There's nothing that I won't do, I'd give up everything

Just to hold you in my arms, one more time

It doesn't matter where I am because

Can't help but look for a trace of you

At every corner store, in the newspaper

Knowing there is no way that you would be there

If I could just believe in miracles,

I would open my heart up once again

In the morning light, a completely new me

I'd tell you what I couldn't say before,

"I love you."

It doesn't matter where I am because

Can't help but to search for your smile

At the railway crossing, watching the trains pass by

Even though there's no way that you'd be there

If I could live my life all over again,

I would be with you for all time

There's nothing else in this world I want more than what I had

There would never be anything but you that I would ask for
